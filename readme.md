# Typescript Web Components starter template

This repo contains a basic template for working with Web Components in Typescript.

## Features

Web Components allow you to create custom HTML elements that can be used in your web pages. This starter template contains basic classes to work with them. The template is:

- ‚öõÔ∏è Modular:
  - write HTML, CSS, and TypeScript in separate files
  - Models and ViewModels, keep the state separate from the DOM
- ü™∂ Minimal:
  - no external dependencies, only Vite and vanilla TypeScript
- üí™ Powerful:
  - pubSub pattern for event handling and communication

### How to: Create Components

*tldr: Extend `WebComponent` to define your own components.*

1. Create an html (and css) file for your component in a new folder
2. Create a new ts class that extends `WebComponent`
3. Use the component either in HTML or in TypeScript:
   - in HTML: `<my-component></my-component>`
   - in TypeScript: `const myComponent = new MyComponent()`
4. (don't forget to call `WebComponentLoader.loadAll().then(() => {...})` at the start of your application)

For examples, see the [ExampleWebComponent](./src/components/ExampleComponent/)

### How to: Communicate

*tldr: Communication is based on the pubSub pattern. Extend `Observable` to make your class observable, use `EventBus` for global communication.*

#### Observable

Extending `Observable` provides a class with basic pubSub functionality:
1. create a class that extends `Observable`
2. call `.addEventListener` on objects of that class to subscribe to events
3. call `notifyAll` to publish an event to all subscribers

For an example, see [Observable](./src/events/Observable.ts)

#### EventBus

If you wish to send global events, you can use the `EventBus` class:
1. import the `EventBus` singleton 
2. call `.addEventListener` to subscribe to events
3. call `.notifyAll` to publish an event to all subscribers

For an example, see [EventBus](./src/events/EventBus.ts)

### How to: Manage state

*tldr: Create Models to define data structures, use them via ViewModels. Use LiveData to make any other object observable.*

#### Model

`Model` represents a basic data structure thats used in your application.
1. extend `Model` and define the properties of your model

For an example, see [Model](./src/data/models/ExampleModel.ts)

#### ModelStore

`ModelStore` is a singleton, where all Models should be stored. That way, they can be accessed from anywhere in the application.
1. import the `ModelStore` singleton
2. use `ModelStore.addModel(model)` to add a model to the store
3. use ModelStore.findModel(), ModelStore.findModels() and ModelStore.getModelById() retrieve models from the store

For an example, see [ModelStore](./src/data/ModelStore.ts)

#### LiveData

`LiveData` is a wrapper class that allows you to make any existing object observable.
1. use `new LiveData(value)` to create a new `LiveData` object
2. call `.addEventListener` to subscribe to changes
3. call `liveData.value` to get the current value
4. call `liveData.value = newValue` to update the value

For an example, see [LiveData](./src/data/LiveData.ts)

#### ViewModel

`ViewModel` is a wrapper class that wraps any Model in a LiveData object. Use ViewModels instead of Models in your components if you want to keep the state of your component separate from the state of your application.
1. call `model.getViewModel()` to get the ViewModel instance of your model
2. use the `LiveValue` methods detailed above to get, set and listen to value changes of the Model

For an example, see [ViewModel](./src/data/ViewModel.ts)

## Usage

1. use the template to create your own repo
2. clone your repo
3. run `npm install`

### Development

1. run `npm run dev`
2. make changes to the code

### Build preview

1. run `npm run build`
2. run `npm run preview` and open the preview in a browser
